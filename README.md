Rivervale Electronic Services front-end menu written in Fitted Software Tools Modula-2

Way back in 1991 my brother-in-law started his own electronics repair company. We tried various ways of computerising things. This was one of them.

See the [xlb](https://github.com/axtens/xlb) project for required non-FST libraries.

Building and/or converting to another Modula-2 is left as a task for the reader and/or the author should he find the time.

Other Modula-2 compilers: [M2F](http://floppsie.comp.glam.ac.uk/Glamorgan/gaius/web/m2fabout.html), [GNU Modula-2](https://www.nongnu.org/gm2/download.html), [XDS](https://github.com/excelsior-oss/xds) and [ADW](https://www.modula2.org/adwm2/).

Other good Modula-2 information can be found at [Peter Moylan](http://www.pmoylan.org/pages/m2/Modula2.html)'s site.
